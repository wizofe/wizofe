### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deep Learning for Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) image reconstruction, that is cardiac MRI or how to scan people's hearts 💖💖💖 in the fastest and most optimal way, so that they're happy through a quick scan.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia, indeed I want to convert my whole workflow, from raw data acquisition, to motion correction and processing!

- 🤝🏽 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting problems withing the deep learning and medical imaging community.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding the core MRI physics. Every day I do learn something new and that's exciting. On the same time the more I learn, the less I feel I am getting there, as there's such a vast amount of knowledge. 

- 💬 Ask me about software engineering practices, sensors, microcontrollers and embedded programming. In fact I work on porting Redox OS (a Rust-based OS) on aarch64. You can read more about my experience on my ![Medium][3.2]][3] blog. I am also an Engineering Editor in the ![Computer Vision News][4] (RSVP), a free magazine for the computer vision community. You can find scientific paper reviews & technology demonstrations each month!

- 📫 How to reach me: I would recommend to contact me through my social media. I am not on any Facebook-owned products but feel free to click on my [![Twitter][1.2]][1] or [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] profiles for instant communication.

-  ⚡ Fun fact: I love swing dancing 🕺 and jazz 🎸 guitar!
