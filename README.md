### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Deep Learning for Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) image reconstruction, that is cardiac MRI or how to scan people's hearts ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’– in the fastest and most optimal way, so that they're happy through a quick scan.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia, indeed I want to convert my whole workflow, from raw data acquisition, to motion correction and processing!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting problems withing the deep learning and medical imaging community.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding the core MRI physics. Every day I do learn something new and that's exciting. On the same time the more I learn, the less I feel I am getting there, as there's such a vast amount of knowledge. 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about software engineering practices, sensors, microcontrollers and embedded programming. In fact I work on porting Redox OS (a Rust-based OS) on aarch64. You can read more about my experience on my [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@wizofe). I am also an Engineering Editor in the (Computer Vision News)[https://www.rsipvision.com/computer-vision-news/] (RSVP), a free magazine for the computer vision community. You can find scientific paper reviews & technology demonstrations each month!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I would recommend to contact me through my social media. I am not on any Facebook-owned products but I do use Twitter and LinkedIn, if you prefer a more instant communication.

-  âš¡ Fun fact: I love swing dancing and jazz guitar!
