### Hi there 👋 Welcome to "MySpace" (ups, just revealed my age 😏)

- 🔭 PhD Candidate in King's College London in the Instute of Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience (IoPPN) and Biomedical and Medical Imaging Sciences (BMEIS). My key goal is to discover phenotypical relations for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in neonatals using fMRI techniques! That is using baby scans with deep learning methods to discover if there are any phenotypical relations that can help with signifying autism in a very young age! Exciting!

- 🌱 Learning Julia the aim is to unify my workflow with it (or Python)!

- 🤝🏽 I’m looking to collaborate with great people on interesting problems in the deep learning and medical imaging community, especially related to ADHD and Autism/ASD.

- 🤔 I’m always welcoming networking and new connections but also help with the psychiatric side of things. Every day I do learn something new and that's exciting. On the same time the more I learn, the less I feel I am getting there, as there's such a vast amount of knowledge. That's what makes the challenge great and keeps me going.

- 💬 Ask me about software engineering practices, sensors, microcontrollers and embedded programming. I worked on porting Redox OS (a Rust-based OS) on ARM aarch64. You can read more about my experience on my [Medium][3.2] blog. I am also an Engineering Editor in the [Computer Vision News][4.2] (RSVP), a free magazine for the computer vision community. You can read there my monthly scientific paper reviews & deep learning/imaging/engineering demonstrations!

- 📫 How to reach me: I would recommend to contact me through my social media. I am not on any Facebook-owned products but feel free to click on my [![Twitter][1.2]][1] or [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] profiles for instant communication.

-  ⚡ Fun fact: I love swing dancing 🕺 and jazz 🎸 guitar!
