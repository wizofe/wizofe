### Hi there 👋 Welcome to "MySpace" (just showed my age)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Deep Learning for Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CMRA) image reconstruction. We are using cardiac MRI, which is a way to image people's hearts 💖💖💖 without using radiation. We try to do this in the fastest and most optimal way, so that they're happy without staying long in the scanner and the clinical workflow is efficient.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia and I want to convert my whole workflow, from raw data acquisition, to motion correction and processing and get rid of MATLAB!

- 🤝🏽 I’m looking to collaborate with great people on interesting problems in the deep learning and medical imaging community.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding the core MRI physics. Every day I do learn something new and that's exciting. On the same time the more I learn, the less I feel I am getting there, as there's such a vast amount of knowledge. That's what makes the challenge great and keeps me going.

- 💬 Ask me about software engineering practices, sensors, microcontrollers and embedded programming. I worked on porting Redox OS (a Rust-based OS) on ARM aarch64. You can read more about my experience on my ![[Medium][3.2]][3] blog. I am also an Engineering Editor in the [![Computer Vision News][4.2]] (RSVP), a free magazine for the computer vision community. You can read there my monthly scientific paper reviews & deep learning/imaging/engineering demonstrations!

- 📫 How to reach me: I would recommend to contact me through my social media. I am not on any Facebook-owned products but feel free to click on my [![Twitter][1.2]][1] or [![LinkedIn][2.2]][2] profiles for instant communication.

-  ⚡ Fun fact: I love swing dancing 🕺 and jazz 🎸 guitar!
